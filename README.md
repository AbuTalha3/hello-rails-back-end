### Hello Rails Back-End
Introduction
Hello, Rails Back-End is a simple Rails application for demonstrating basic `CRUD operations` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a `RESTful API approach`. This application serves as a starting point for developers who want to learn how to build back-end services using `Ruby on Rails`.

### Features
CRUD operations for managing posts.
RESTful API endpoints for interacting with posts.
Basic authentication for creating, updating, and deleting posts.
JSON responses for API endpoints.
Setup
Follow these steps to set up the Hello Rails Back-End application:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-rails-back-end.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd hello-rails-back-end
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
bundle install
Set up the database:

bash
Copy code
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
Start the Rails server:

bash
Copy code
rails server
Access the API:
The API endpoints will be available at http://localhost:3000/api/posts.

API Endpoints
GET /api/posts: Get a list of all posts.
POST /api/posts: Create a new post (requires authentication).
GET /api/posts/:id: Get details of a specific post.
PUT /api/posts/:id: Update a specific post (requires authentication).
DELETE /api/posts/:id: Delete a specific post (requires authentication).
Authentication
Basic authentication is used for creating, updating, and deleting posts. When making requests that require authentication, include the following header:

bash
Copy code
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
Replace base64(username:password) with your base64-encoded username and password. For example:

makefile
Copy code
Authorization: Basic QWJ1OnRlc3QxMjM=
The above example is base64 encoding of Abu: Test123.
