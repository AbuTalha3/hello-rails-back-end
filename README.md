Introduction
Hello Rails Back-End is a simple Rails application for demonstrating basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a RESTful API approach. This application serves as a starting point for developers who want to learn how to build back-end services using Ruby on Rails.

Features
CRUD operations for managing posts.
RESTful API endpoints for interacting with posts.
Basic authentication for creating, updating, and deleting posts.
JSON responses for API endpoints.
